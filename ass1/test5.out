Your task in this assignment is to implement the static Arithmetic Coding algorithm (both encoder and decoder) as presented in the lecture week 1 in C/C++. You will also need to provide a makefile to compile your source files and generate an executable program running on a typical CSE Linux machine. In case if you have never created a makefile before, a sample C program with a very simple makefile is available here. You shall modify it accordingly for your assignment solution (e.g., g++ instead of gcc; different c, cpp or header files; include different libraries). You may include and use any C or C++ libraries available in CSE linux machines. Your encoder and decoder (called aencode and adecode, respectively) will take input from the standard input, and produce output to the standard output. The encoder should output the AC encoded value in decimal digits (for learning purposes), instead of conventional binary output. Similarly, the decoder will read the encoded message in decimal digits as input.
